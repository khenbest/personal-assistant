## 🎯 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **WhisperKit Performance**: Pre-optimize models, have API fallback
- **Memory Limitations**: Implement aggressive cleanup, pagination
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement caching, request queuing
- **Offline Functionality**: Queue actions, sync when online

### Cost Risks
- **Supabase Limits**: Monitor usage weekly, optimize queries
- **LLM Costs**: Maximize Ollama usage, implement quotas
- **Hosting Overages**: Set up alerts, have migration plan
