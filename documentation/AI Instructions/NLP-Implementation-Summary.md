## 🤖 AI Assistance Integration

Throughout implementation, use your UnifiedLLMService to:

1. **Generate Training Data**:
```javascript
await llmService.process({
  prompt: "Generate 100 examples of calendar scheduling commands",
  responseFormat: 'json'
});
```

2. **Create Test Cases**:
```javascript
await llmService.process({
  prompt: "Generate edge cases for date parsing including ambiguous times",
  responseFormat: 'json'
});
```

3. **Improve Accuracy**:
```javascript
await llmService.process({
  prompt: "Analyze these misclassifications and suggest improvements",
  complexity: 'medium'
});
```

## 📚 Key Technologies Utilized

- **Existing Assets**: UnifiedLLMService, Supabase, Expo
- **New Additions**: chrono-node, winkNLP, @xenova/transformers
- **ML Frameworks**: TensorFlow.js or ONNX Runtime
- **Storage**: pgvector for embeddings, Supabase for persistence

## 🏆 Expected Outcomes

By completing all three sprints, you will have:

1. **World-Class NLP System**: 95% accuracy with self-learning
2. **Lightning Fast**: <100ms on-device classification
3. **Continuously Improving**: Every correction makes it better
4. **Production Ready**: Fully tested, monitored, documented
5. **Cost Effective**: Minimal ongoing costs with local inference

---

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions are documented in each day's implementation guide. The system is designed to gracefully fall back:

1. TF.js fails → Use embeddings
2. Embeddings fail → Use LLM
3. LLM fails → Use cached results
4. Cache miss → Return low confidence

This ensures the system never fails completely and always provides a response.
