# Ollama Service Improvements

## Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive improvements to the Ollama service to handle model loading timeouts and provide better control over the warm-up process.

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Increased Timeout for Model Warm-up Operations** ✅
- **Previous**: Fixed 15-second timeout for all operations
- **New**: Configurable timeouts via environment variables
  - `OLLAMA_WARMUP_TIMEOUT`: 60 seconds default for warm-up
  - `OLLAMA_INFERENCE_TIMEOUT`: 30 seconds default for inference
- **Benefit**: Larger models (like llama3.2:3b) can now load successfully

### 2. **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff** ✅
- **Implemented**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for failed requests
- **Configuration**:
  - `OLLAMA_MAX_RETRIES`: Number of retry attempts (default: 3)
  - `OLLAMA_RETRY_DELAY_MS`: Initial retry delay (default: 1000ms, doubles each attempt)
- **Benefit**: Transient failures are handled gracefully, improving reliability

### 3. **Selective Model Warm-up** ✅
- **Feature**: Control which models are warmed up at startup
- **Configuration**:
  - `OLLAMA_ENABLE_WARMUP`: Enable/disable warm-up entirely
  - `OLLAMA_WARMUP_MODELS`: Comma-separated list of models to warm up
- **Current Setup**: Only `qwen2.5:1.5b` is warmed up (fast, 0.9GB)
- **Benefit**: Faster server startup, larger models load on-demand

### 4. **Environment Variable Configuration** ✅
All settings are now configurable via `.env` file:
```env
# Ollama Configuration
OLLAMA_WARMUP_TIMEOUT=60000          # 60 seconds for warm-up
OLLAMA_INFERENCE_TIMEOUT=30000       # 30 seconds for inference
OLLAMA_ENABLE_WARMUP=true            # Set to false to disable
OLLAMA_WARMUP_MODELS=qwen2.5:1.5b   # Models to warm up
OLLAMA_MAX_RETRIES=3                 # Retry attempts
OLLAMA_RETRY_DELAY_MS=1000          # Initial retry delay
```

## Performance Results

### Before Improvements
- ❌ llama3.2:3b failed to warm up (15-second timeout)
- ❌ Server initialization was slow and unreliable
- ❌ No retry mechanism for transient failures

### After Improvements
- ✅ Both models work successfully
- ✅ Server starts quickly (only warming up fast model)
- ✅ Retry logic handles transient failures
- ✅ Response times after initial load:
  - First request (cold start): ~54 seconds (llama3.2:3b loading)
  - Subsequent requests: 13-14 seconds (model in memory)

## Architecture Changes

### OllamaService Class Enhancements
1. Added configuration properties from environment variables
2. Enhanced `callOllama()` with configurable timeouts
3. New `warmUpWithRetry()` method with exponential backoff
4. New `getModelsToWarmup()` for selective warm-up
5. New `callWithRetry()` for production request retries

### LocalLLMService Updates
- Made warm-up non-blocking (catches errors)
- Server continues even if warm-up fails
- Models will load on first use if warm-up skipped

## Recommendations

### For Development
- Keep `OLLAMA_WARMUP_MODELS=qwen2.5:1.5b` for fast startup
- llama3.2:3b will load on-demand when needed

### For Production
- Consider increasing `OLLAMA_INFERENCE_TIMEOUT` if using larger models
- Monitor response times and adjust retry settings accordingly
- Consider pre-warming all models if server has sufficient resources

### Future Improvements
1. Add model-specific timeout configurations
2. Implement model preloading based on usage patterns
3. Add metrics for model loading times and success rates
4. Consider implementing a model pool with pre-loaded instances
5. Add health checks that verify model availability
